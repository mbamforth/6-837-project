README - Assignment #2
Miren Bamforth

1) You compile the code by typing make while in the correct directory. You run it with debug/a2 data/ModelName.

2) I did not collaborate with anyone.

3) I looked at wikipedia, C++ documentation, and a bunch of things that were linked to from the piazza site.

4) I have an error with SSD. The mesh loads correctly, but when a joint is rotated, the mesh disappears. I realize this is a pretty significant thing not to have implemented correctly...I'm pretty sure the problem is in updateMesh as opposed to in any of the transform stuff. I'm going to try to fix it- I just wanted to get a preliminary submission in.

5) I didn't do any extra credit.

6) This was good! I liked how it guided me enough so that I knew what was expected but still left a lot of room for me to learn and figure things out on my own.
